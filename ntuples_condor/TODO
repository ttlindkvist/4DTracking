NOTES:
Hard scatter should be first element in both truth and reco
Always check HS reco vs truth

TODO:
- Compare reco HS vs truth HS
- Fit avg time - fits with 180 ps sigma?
- Reco vertex with smearing - compare to truth
    - Focus on HS
    - Check if there is another hard enough PU vertex - eg via sum pT square cut?
- Plot of all time (not avg) of tracks in reco vs reco z1


DONE:
- plot delta Z for reco with sum pT square > 15 GeV (or 5, 10 GeV)
- Plot of reco sum p_t square - distinguish between HS and PU
- Eta bin track prob vs pT
- Track prob vs pixel hits - eta separated
