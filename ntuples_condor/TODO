Hard scatter should be first element in both truth and reco

Eta bin track prob vs pT

Fit avg time - fits with 180 ps sigma?

Reco vertex with smearing - compare to truth
- Focus on HS
- Check if there is another hard enough PU vertex

Always check HS reco vs truth

Plot of reco sum p_t square - distinguish between HS and PU

Plot of all time (not avg) of tracks in reco vs reco z1

plot delta Z for reco with sum pT square > 15 GeV (or 5, 10 GeV)
